# Intelligent Rust-Based ESP32 System for Real-Time IoT and Process Simulation
---

This repository contains the work for the research paper: **"Development of an Intelligent Rust-Based Embedded System for SHT20 Modbus RTU and DWSIM AC Simulation Integration with Real-Time IoT Connectivity"**.

The project presents a smart, reliable embedded system built on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller and programmed entirely in **Rust**. It bridges the gap between physical industrial sensors and virtual process simulations by creating a real-time, "hardware-in-the-loop" environment. The system monitors an air conditioning (AC) process, uses live sensor data to drive a thermodynamic simulation in DWSIM, and visualizes all data on a modern IoT platform.

## üìã Key Features

**Rust-Based Firmware**: Developed using Rust for its memory safety, high concurrency, and performance, ensuring robust and reliable industrial communication.
**Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation**: Integrates a physical SHT20 Modbus RTU sensor with a DWSIM AC process simulation in a closed loop. Live temperature and humidity data dynamically drive the simulation.
**Bidirectional Control**: The system is not just for monitoring. It uses the output from the DWSIM simulation to control physical actuators (a fan and a pump), mimicking a real-world control system.
**Real-Time IoT Dashboard**: All sensor and simulation data is published to an MQTT broker and visualized in real-time on the ThingsBoard platform.
**Time-Series Data Storage**: Uses InfluxDB for high-performance storage and querying of all time-series data, enabling historical analysis.
**Industrial Protocol Support**: Utilizes the robust Modbus RTU protocol for communication between the ESP32-S3 and the industrial-grade SHT20 sensor.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is orchestrated by an **ESP32-S3 microcontroller**, which acts as the central hub. It acquires data from the **SHT20 sensor** via Modbus RTU, communicates with the **DWSIM** simulation over Wi-Fi (via a Python API), and controls the physical fan and pump. Simultaneously, it publishes all data to an **MQTT Broker**, which then forwards it to **InfluxDB** for storage and **ThingsBoard** for visualization.

## üíª Software, Simulation & Technology Stack

The system's logic is divided between the embedded firmware and the process simulation model.

**Embedded Firmware**: Written entirely in **Rust**. It handles polling the sensor, communicating with the DWSIM API, controlling the relays, and publishing data via MQTT.
**Process Simulation**: A **DWSIM** model of a Heat Exchanger simulates the AC cooling coil. The `Air_In` temperature is updated by the SHT20 sensor, and DWSIM calculates the resulting `Air_Out` temperature.

    *Figure 3: DWSIM Heat Exchanger Model*
**API Bridge**: A **Python script** exposes the DWSIM simulation as a REST API, allowing the ESP32-S3 to interact with it over the network.
**Backend & IoT Platform**:
    * **Database**: **InfluxDB** is used for time-series data storage.
    * **Visualization**: **ThingsBoard** provides the real-time dashboards, charts, and widgets.
    * **Communication**: An **MQTT Broker** handles message routing between the ESP32-S3 and the backend.

## üöÄ How It Works: A Demonstration

The system operates in a continuous, real-time loop, bridging the physical and virtual worlds.

### 1. Real-Time Data Acquisition
The system reads temperature and humidity from the SHT20 sensor. This live data is then immediately sent to update the DWSIM simulation's `Air_In` parameter.

*Figure 4: Terminal log showing SHT20 data being sent to DWSIM*

### 2. Thermodynamic Simulation
With the updated `Air_In` value (e.g., **32.4¬∞C**), DWSIM runs its thermodynamic calculations and computes the cooled `Air_Out` temperature (e.g., **11.977¬∞C**).

### 3. Data Transmission to IoT Platforms
The calculated `Air_Out` value is retrieved from DWSIM and uploaded via MQTT to InfluxDB and ThingsBoard, completing the data loop.

### 4. Data Aggregation and Visualization
All data streams are aggregated in the InfluxDB database and visualized in the ThingsBoard dashboard, providing a complete overview of both the physical and simulated parameters.
